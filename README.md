# WHAC - A - MOLE Study Buddy



## Introduction

In today's fast-paced world, finding innovative ways to make learning enjoyable and engaging is crucial. With this in mind, we introduce a new app that combines the classic arcade game Whac-A-Mole with the challenge of trivia questions. Our app offers users a unique opportunity to test their knowledge across various subjects while having fun.


## Introduction â€“ Whac A Mole

The game Whac-A-Mole, originating from Japan in 1975, stands as a timeless arcade classic. The game's setup typically includes a waist-level cabinet housing a play area and display screen, accompanied by a substantial soft mallet. Within the play area, holes are populated by small, plastic, whimsical moles or other characters that unpredictably pop up. Players score points by swiftly whacking each mole as it emerges, with faster reactions yielding higher scores. Its simple yet engaging mechanics have made Whac-A-Mole a beloved fixture in arcades worldwide, providing players of all ages with a delightful and challenging experience.


## Game Description

Users begin by selecting their preferred subject from a diverse range of options, including music, books, sports, and more. They can also choose the difficulty level of the questions, catering to both beginners and experts alike. Once the settings are chosen, the game begins.
As the game unfolds, players are presented with trivia questions displayed prominently on the screen, along with possible answers (the questions are dynamically selected based on the subject and difficulty level that the player chose at the beginning of the game).
However, there's a twist: reminiscent of the Whac-A-Mole arcade game, a board featuring playful moles pops up simultaneously. Each mole holds one of the possible answers.
The challenge is to swiftly identify the correct answer and tap the corresponding mole before it disappears.
Each session includes trivia questions, with players aiming to achieve a maximum score of 100 points. Correct answers earn 10 points, while incorrect ones result in a deduction of 5 points. Players must be cautious, as accumulating 5 incorrect answers ends the game, while reaching 100 points marks a successful completion, allowing players to start a new game.


## Statistics

In our app, there is a Statistics section that provides users with insights into their practice performance, helping users to track their progress and identify areas for improvement.

One of the key components is the progress chart, which provides a visual representation of the performance across different subjects in the trivia. As you continue to practice, regardless of whether your answers are correct or incorrect, the chart dynamically adjusts to reflect the progress in each subject. This allows the user to easily see which subjects they have practiced the most and those that may require additional attention. 

Additionally, when you start practicing the trivia game, a pie chart appears, showcasing the percentage of correct answers you've achieved overall. This chart is segmented by subjects, giving you insights into the proportion of correct answers within each subject area, enabling the user to focus their efforts accordingly.

## Project Components and Technologies

### TypeScript
We used TypeScript in our project due to its ability to provide type options, significantly enhancing our ability to detect and rectify bugs during the development process.
### React with Vite
React, a JavaScript library renowned for building user interfaces, serves as the cornerstone of the Whac-A-Mole StudyBuddy project. With React's component-based architecture, we create reusable UI elements, enhancing maintainability and scalability. React's virtual DOM ensures seamless updates and optimal performance, fostering a responsive user experience. Paired with Vite, a modern build tool acting as the bundler, React enables rapid iteration with fast bundling and hot module replacement. This collaboration between React and Vite significantly boosts developer productivity and streamlines the development experience specific to Whac-A-Mole StudyBuddy.
### React Router
React Router plays a pivotal role in facilitating client-side routing within Whac-A-Mole StudyBuddy. Leveraging React Router, we implement declarative routing and define navigation logic through components and URLs. This empowers users to seamlessly navigate between study modes and statistics without the inconvenience of full-page reloads, thereby enhancing the user experience.
### Trivia API
The integration of the Trivia API into the Whac-A-Mole StudyBuddy project serves as a vital component. Leveraging the Trivia API, we access a vast repository of study questions spanning various subjects and difficulty levels. Dynamically fetching study questions ensures an engaging and diverse study experience for users, with real-time updates and dynamic content enriching user interaction and encouraging exploration.
### Render
For deployment and hosting, we rely on Render, a robust platform that offers scalable infrastructure and automated deployments. By hosting Whac-A-Mole StudyBuddy on Render, we ensure high availability and reliability, enabling seamless access for users to the application's study resources and features.
